    LiteStep 0.24.7
    Changelog
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


-- NOTE ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 0.24.7 code is based on the 2002-01-03 pre-0.24.6 source. Some of the
 functionality that was added to the 0.24.6 branch after this date (mostly Indie
 LS changes) was reimplemented in 0.24.7. See below for a list of these
 functions and for what is missing.


-- CHANGES SINCE 0.24.6 --------------------------------------------------------

 - Removed all COM.

 - Cleaned up the code... this includes numerous fixes, formatting, and source 
   beautifications.

 - Massive improvements in StartupRunner and TrayService.  Visible items are:
   * On NT systems, LiteStep detects if startup items have been run before or
     not. This is the same method that Explorer uses to detect if it should
     rerun startup items in the event that the shell crashes. Thus the
     -nostartup switch is obsolete on NT systems.
   * Added command line switch -startup to force running of the startup items.
   * StartupRunner now has RunOnceEx support.
   * TrayService rewrite enables support for the language indicator icon
    (but not on WinXP) and fixes many other problematic icons.

 - Fixed XP logon delay

 - Merged LiteMAN functionallity (i.e. DDE) into the LiteStep core. It is now
   called DDEService and loaded by default. Liteman.dll should no longer be
   loaded.

 - Added "LSUseSystemDDE". This loads the Windows DDE server instead of the
   DDEService. This may result in slightly larger memory usage but "proper" DDE
   support. LSUseSystemDDE takes effect on startup only, not on !recycle.
   Requires shdocvw.dll from IE.

 - Added !HideModules and !ShowModules to hide or show all module windows.
   !ToggleModules is also available.

 - If "LSAutoHideModules" is specified LS tries to automatically hide all module
   windows if a full-screen app is detected. Once the full-screen app exits the
   modules are redisplayed.

 - LCOpen uses a separate SettingsMap for each file opened with LCOpen. This is
   the thread-safe approach but makes it impossible for modules to use the
   GetRC* APIs to retrieve settings from those files. For example this affects
   Rabidvwm which can no longer read its settings directly from .box files. Put
   the settings into step.rc instead or "include" the .box file(s) as a
   workaround.

 - Added inform-sega's ShellExecute fix for .lnk files. This enables LSExecute()
   to execute .lnk files.

 - Removed support for PixmapPath (use LSImageFolder instead), ThemeFile,
   LSThemeFile, and LSColorBGR.
 
 - Modules are loaded and unloaded asynchronously (at the same time) if
   threaded. This should lead to faster start and recycle times if threading is
   used. Specify a threaded module by:  LoadModule <file> threaded

 - All MessageBoxes (including !alert and !confirm) should now always have focus
   and appear ontop of the active window.
 
 - The Recovery Menu cannot be closed permanently with ALT-F4 any more.

 - Improved handling of exceptions in threaded modules.

 - Improved handling of exceptions during !bang execution.

 - Optimized BitmapToRegion, LoadLSImage, LoadLSIcon, BitmapFromIcon.

 - Added new step.rc setting "LSDisableTrayService". Setting this value disables
   the core's system tray support.

 - LM_UN/RELOADMODULE can now un/reload modules by using the HINSTANCE of the
   module as the wParam. Set the lParam to LMM_HINSTANCE in that case.
   !Reloadmodule and !unloadmodule take advantage of this and should thus no
   longer crash even if a module tries to un-/reload itself.

 - Removed -install and -uninstall.

 - Removed !ToggleWharf and !Popup from the core.

 - Added EnumLSData export to lsapi. This gives modules like lscp a consistent
   interface to poll core data.

 - etc. etc.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES ADDED TO 0.24.7 --------------------------------------------

 - GetRCCoordinate and ParseCoordinate added to lsapi for reading coordinates
   with negative and centered support.

 - Some typos in the string tables were corrected.

 - $windir$ is guaranteed to end with a backslash ('\').

 - Math evaluation in VarExpansion (can be disabled at compiletime).

 - Stubs in lsapi for the logging APIs (minimal logging support can be enabled
   at compiletime) and for the Get-/SetVariable APIs.

 - Addition of $WinXP$, $compiledate$, and $quicklaunch$.

 - Removal of !ToggleWharf and !Popup from lsapi.
 
 - c0atzin's RegisterShellHook() fix for Win9x.


-- INDIE LS CHANGES NOT ADDED TO 0.24.7 ----------------------------------------

 - All changes made to the recovery menu and the aboutbox.

 - !setvar, !emptytrashbin

 - system color / font variables, OS-* variables.

 - LSCP (including !lscp). This will have to be rewritten to work.
